I created this app for fun and to share with the travel community. Here's what you should know:

- **Free & Casual** - This is currently free to use, but that might change in the future
- **No Guarantees** - The app might stop working, change significantly, or even disappear entirely
- **Hobby Project** - I'm not a professional app developer, just an enthusiast sharing something useful
- **Use at Your Own Risk** - No warranties, no guarantees, no commitments
- **Feature Requests Welcome** - Feel free to suggest features, but please don't be upset if I don't add them
- **Best Effort** - I'll try to keep it running, but life happens and priorities change

**Bottom Line:** Enjoy it while it's here, but don't rely on it for critical trip planning. Always have backup plans and offline maps!

2. Click the **circle** (○) next to the name
3. It turns into a **green checkmark** (✓)
